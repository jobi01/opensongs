  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Bm9
 Am I asking for the moon?
.       Gmaj7/9                G6  Em9
 Is it really so implausible?
.                      Em9/A  A7
 That you and I could soon
.         Dmaj7                     F#7sus4  F#7
 Come to some kind of arrangement?
.        Bm9                  Gmaj7/9
 I'm not asking for the moon
.                            G6
 I've always been a realist
.           Em9                 Em9/A  A7
 When it's really nothing more
.        Dmaj7                F#7sus4  F#7
 Than a simple rearrangement.

[V2]
.          Bm                   C7sus4  C7
 With one roof above our heads
.   F#m                  F#mmaj7  F#m7
 A warm house to return to
.    Em9                            Em9/A  A7
 We could start with separate beds
.          Dmaj7         F#7sus4  F#7
 I could sleep alone or learn to
.         Bm                      Bm/A           G#m7/b5     Em9
 I'm not suggesting that we'd find some earthly paradise forever
.           Cmaj7                      Bm/F#                         F#7
 I mean how often does that happen now? The answer's probably never
.              Gmaj7/b5                    Em6/9
 But we could come to an arrangement, a practical arrangement
.     C#9/sus4            F#7/5+         Bm9  Gm9  G7/9+
 And you could learn to love me given time

[V3]
.          Cm9
 I'm not promising the moon
.          Abmaj7             Ab6
 I'm not promising a rainbow
.         Fm9               Bb7sus4  Bb7
 Just a practical solution
.      Ebmaj7        G7sus4  G7
 To a solitary life
.          Cm9
 I'd be a father to your boy
.    Abmaj7                    Fm9
 A shoulder you could lean on
.                     Bb7sus4  Bb7  Ebmaj7
 How bad could it be
.                G7sus4  G7
 To be my wife?

.          Cm                   D7/b9  D7
 With one roof above our heads
.   Gm                   Gmmaj7  Gm7
 A warm house to return to
.     Fm7                       Bb7sus4  Bb7
 You wouldn't have to cook for me
.     Ebmaj7                    G7sus4  G7
 You wouldn't have to learn to
.            Cm                 Cm/Bb         Am7/b5          Fm9
 I'm not suggesting that this proposition here could last forever
.           Dbmaj7               Cm/G                 G7
 I've no intention of deceiving you, you're far too clever

.              Abmaj7/b5
 But we could come to an arrangement
.    Fm6/9
 A practical arrangement
.     D9/sus4                      G7/5+     Fm9  G7/5+
 And perhaps you'd learn to love me given time
.    Abmaj7         Cm/Bb            Am7/b5  Fm9
 It may not be the romance that you had in mind
.               D7sus4           G7/5+
 But you could learn to love me
. Db9   Csus2
