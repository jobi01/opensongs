.Bm  G
.Bm  G

[V1]
.D                          Bm
 Don't think sorry's easily said
.D                          Bm
 Don't try turning tables instead
.       G                       Gm
 You've taken lots of chances before
.    Bm                     E
 But I ain't gonna give any more - Don't ask me
.D
 That's how it goes
.       G                            D
 'Cause part of me knows what you're thinking

[V2]
.D                              Bm
 Don't say words you're gonna regret
.D                               Bm
 Don't let the fire rush to your head
.     G                      Gm   
 I've heard the accusation before
.    Bm                     E
 And I ain't gonna take any more - Believe me
.    D
 The sun in your eyes
.     G                        D
 Made some of the lies worth believing

[Chorus]
.         D
 I am the eye in the sky

 Looking at you
.F#m
 I can read your mind
.         D
 I am the maker of rules

 Dealing with fools
.F#m
 I can cheat you blind
.    G                       Gm
 And I don't need to see any more
.             Bm                    G
 To know that I can read your mind, I can read your mind
.Bm                    G
 I can read your mind, I can read your mind

[V3]
.D                             Bm
 Don't leave false illusions behind
.D                                    Bm
 Don't cry 'cause I ain't changing my mind
.   G                        Gm
 So find another fool like before
.       Bm                    E
 'Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
.D                      G                    D
 Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving

[Chorus]
.         D
 I am the eye in the sky

 Looking at you
.F#m
 I can read your mind
.         D
 I am the maker of rules

 Dealing with fools
.F#m
 I can cheat you blind
.    G                       Gm
 And I don't need to see any more
.             Bm                    G
 To know that I can read your mind, I can read your mind
.Bm                    G
 I can read your mind, I can read your mind
