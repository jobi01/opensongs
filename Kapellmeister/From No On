[V1]
.Cm/F       Bb/F
 Monday has come around again
.           Cm/F
 I'm in the same old place
.    Bb/F           Fsus4 F     Fsus2   F
 the same old faces always watching     me
.Cm/F          Bb/F
 Who knows how long I'll have to stay
.           Bb/F
 Could be a hundred years
.Cm/F
 Of sweat and tears
.       Fsus4     F     Fsus2  F 
 At the rate that I get paid

[B]
.Dm9         Am9
 Sometimes I slowly drift away
.Dm9
 From all the dull routine
.       Am9
 That's with me every day
.  Cm7          Bbm7
 A fantasy will come to me

[V2]
.Cm/F         Bb/F
 Diamonds are what I really need
.           Cm/F         Bb/F
 Think I'll rob a store, escape the law
.Fsus4 F     Fsus2  F
 And live in Italy

.Cm/F      Bb/F
 Lately my luck has been so bad
.             Cm/F
 You know the roulette wheel's
.  Bb/F
 A crooked deal
.    Fsus4   F     Fsus2 F
 I'm loosing all I had

[B]
.Dm9            Am9 
 Soon be like a man that's on the run
.Dm9
 And live from day to day 
.      Am9 
 Never needing anyone 
.Cm7 
 Play hide and seek 
.Bbm7 
 Throughout the week 

.( Bb  Dm/A  Dm7(5-)  /  Ab  Gsus4 G7 ) 

.( Eb  Bb/D  Cm7  F ) 

 My life is full of romance 

[C]
.                          Gm7 
 Guess I'll always have to be 
.C                 F 
 Living in a fantasy 
.Dm7                        Gm7 
 That's the way it's got to be 
.C        F     Dm7 
 From now on 

.                        Gm7 
 Yes I'll always have to be 
.C                 F 
 Living in a fantasy 
.Dm7                       Gm7 
 Though it won't be really me 
.C        F      Dm7 
 From now on 

.                          Gm7 
 You think I'm crazy I can see 
.C                            F 
 It's you for you, and me for me 
.Dm7               Gm7 
 Living in a fantasy 
.C        F     Dm7 
 From now on</lyrics>
