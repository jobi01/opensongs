.Ab             Cm6/A         Bbm7                    Eb7/G
 You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
.Gb             Gb/Eb                         Db
 See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen

[V1]
.Db                              Gbm6/Db
 Friday night and the lights are low
.Db                        Ab/C  Bbm
 Looking out for the place to    go
.Ab                        Db/Ab  Ab             Db\Ab
 Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
.    Cm6/A      Bbm7            Ab Bbm
 You come in to look for a king

[V2]
.Db                    Gbm6/Db
 Anybody could be that guy
.Db                     Ab/C    Bbm
 Night is young and the music’s high
.Ab                 Db/Ab  Ab            Db\Ab
 With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
.Cm6/A         Bbm7            Ab Bbm
 You’re in the mood for a dance
.             Ebm7           Ab7
 And when you get the chance...

[C]
.            Db             Gb/Db                 Db       Gb/Db
 You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
.Db             Gb/Db                  Db       Ab/C Db/Bb
 Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
.Ab             F7            Bbm                     Eb7/G
 You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
.Gb             Ebm7                          Db
 See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen

[V3]
.Db                             Gbm6/Db
 You’re a teaser, you turn them on
.Db                     Ab/C        Bbm
 Leave them burning and then you’re gone
.Ab              Db/Ab    Ab          Db\Ab
 Looking out for another, anyone will do
.Cm6/A         Bbm7             Ab Bbm
 You’re in the mood for a dance
.             Ebm7           Ab7
 And when you get the chance...
