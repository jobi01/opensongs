  <lyrics>[V1]
.            D     G        D    G 
 When you're weary, feeling small 
.     C     G   D D7+   Em           D           G D G D 
 When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all (all) 
.D   A/C# G/B  A     A7                 D    D/C# D/C  
 I'm on   your side, oh, when times get rough 
.D   D/E     D/F# G     E  A 
 And friends just can't be found

[C]
.D      G6     G5 B/G# D        B7/F# B7 G   
 Like a bridge o  ver  troubled water 
.       A7/A#  Bm 
 I will lay me down 
.D      G6     G5 B/G# D        B7/F# B7 G 
 Like a bridge o  ver  troubled water 
.       A7/A#  D    G G4 G D D/F#*(XX42XX) D/E*(XX22XX) D G G4 G 
 I will lay me down 

[V1]
 When you're down and out 
 When you're on the street 
 When evening falls so hard 
 I will comfort you (ooh) 
 I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes 
 And pain is all around 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will lay me down 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
.              Bm   
 I will lay me down 

[Instrumental]
.Bm/A#(X14432) E E/D#(X6X454) D A6 A G Bm G Gm D D/F#*D/E* D G G4 G 

[V1]
 Sail on silver girl 
 Sail on by 
 Your time has come to shine 
 All your dreams are on their way 
 See how they shine 
 Oh, if you need a friend 
 I'm sailing right behind 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will ease your mind 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will ease your mind 

.Bm/A#(X14432) E E/D#(X6X454) D A6 A G Bm G Gm D</lyrics>
