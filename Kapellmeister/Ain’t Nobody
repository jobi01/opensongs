[V1]
.Em7	     D7     Em7	           D7     Cm
 Captured effortlessly, that’s the way it was
.	            Bm7           Cm          D7
 Happened so naturally, I did not know it was love 
.Em7	               D7               Em7                  D7
 The next thing I felt was you,       holding me close 
.Cm	       Bm7             Cm 	      D7
 What was I gonna do?         I let myself go 
.B7	                            Cm	
 And now we're flyin' through the stars 
.	    D7	               Em7
 I hope this night will last forever 

[V2]
 I've been waitin' for you, It's been so long 
 I knew just what I would do, When I heard your song 

 Filled my heart with your bliss, gave me freedom 
 You knew I could not resist, I needed someone 
 And now we're flyin' through the stars 
 I hope this ni-ght will last forever… Huh, Huh, Huh, Hu-h! 

[C]
.Em7       D7        Am7         C7     
 Ain't nobody, Loves me better 
.Em7        D7         Am7         C7  ^D7
 Makes me happy, Makes me feel this way 
.Em7       D7        Am7         C7 D7       Em7
 Ain't nobody, loves me better than you 

;Reprise Intro

[V3]
 I wait for night time to come, and bring you to me 
 Can't believe I'm the one, I was so lo-nely 
 I feel like no one could feel, I must be dreamin' 
 I want this dream to be real, I need this fee-lin' 
 I make my wish upon a star
 And hope this night will last forever… Hoh, Hoh, Hoh Ho-h!

[C]
 Ain't nobody, (nobody!) loves me better 
 Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
 Ain't nobody, (nobody babe…) loves me better 
 Ain't nobody, loves me better than you  

[B]
.Em7 D6  Am7    C7

 And first you put your arms around me 
 Then you put your charms around me 
 I can't resist this sweet surrender 
 Oh, my nights are warm and tender 
 We stare into each other's eyes 
 And what we see is no surprise 
 Got a feeling most with treasure 
 And a love so deep we cannot measure!

[C]
 Ain't nobody,    loves me better 
 Makes me happy,  makes me feel this way
 Ain't nobody,    loves me better
 Ain't nobody,    loves me better 
 (Repeat 4x, last time “ A prima Vista” )

 Ain't nobody,   loves me better than you</lyrics>
