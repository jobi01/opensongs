  <lyrics>[V1]
.D6
 Babe I'm leaving I must be on my way 
.Em7                 G/A   A 
 The time is drawing near 
.D6 
 My train is going I see it in your eyes 
.Em7                      G/A   A 
 The love beneath your tears 
.Bm                   Gmaj7 A 
 But I'll be lonely without you 
.Gmaj7                             A       G/A  A 
 And I'll need your love to see me through 
.D6 
 So please believe me my heart is in your hand and 
.Em7     G/A     D6 
 I'll be missing you 

[C]
.G/A                  A      A/D 
 'Cause you know it's you babe 
.    G/D 
 Whenever I get weary 
.            Bm      A 
 And I've had enough 
.             Bm      A 
 Feel like giving up 
.              D    A/D 
 You know it's you babe 
.G/D  
 Giving me the courage 
.            Bm           A 
 And the strength I need 
.Bm        A                Gmaj7 
 Please believe that it's true 
.                  D6   Em7 D6 G/A A 
 Babe, I love you 
 
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
 
[V2]  
.D6 
 Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again 
.Em7                 G/A   A 
 And somehow try to smile 
.D6 
 I know the feeling we're trying to forget 
.Em7         G/A   A 
 If only for a while 
.Bm                       Gmaj7   A 
 'Cause I'll be lonely without you 
.Gmaj7                             A       G/A  A 
 And I'll need your love to see me through 
.D6 
 But believe me, my heart is in your hands 
.Em7     G/A     D6 
 'Cause I'll be missing you 

.Em7          D6 
 Babe, I love you 
.Em7          D6 
 Babe, I love you 
.G/A        D6 
 Oooh, ooh, babe
