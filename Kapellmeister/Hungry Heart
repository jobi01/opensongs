  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C Am7 Dm7 G7sus 
 
[V1]
.C                      Am7
 Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack
.      Dm7                  G7sus
 I went out for a ride and I never went back
.C                       Am7
 Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
.Dm7                       G7sus 
 I took a wrong turn and I just kept going 
 
[C]
.C                 Am7 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.C                           Am7 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a huh-uh-un-gry heart 
 
[V2]
.C              Am7 
 I met her in a Kingstown bar 
.Dm7                    G7sus 
 We fell in love I knew it had to end 
.C                          Am7 
 We took what we had and we ripped it apart 
.Dm7                   G7sus 
 Now here I am down in Kingstown again 
 
[C]
.C                 Am7 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.C                           Am7 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a huh-uh-un-gry heart 
  
[SOLO]
 Eb  Cm7  Fm7  Ab/Bb  Eb  Cm7  Fm7  G7sus 
 
[V3]
.C                 Am7
 Everybody's needs a place to rest
.Dm7               G7sus
 Everybody's wants to have a home
.C                           Am7
 Don´t make no difference what nobody says 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Ain´t nobody like to be alone 
 
[C]
.C                 Am7 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
.C                           Am7 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
.Dm7               G7sus 
 Everybody's got a huh-uh-un-gry heart
